# SHVC-LZ

A collection of decoders for various modern variants of Lempel-Ziv style compression targeting the Super Famicom/Nintendo system.

Common characteristics:
- Designed for speed over code size.
- Designed to run from ROM â€“ no self-modifying code.
- Full 24-bit addresses for source and destination are freely set at the call site.
- Uses DMA registers for temporary variables allowing for faster access than RAM.
- Uses DMA when copying literal strings.
- The compressed data or the decompression buffer may not cross bank boundaries.

Statistics (speeds in KB/s on a Super Nintendo @ 3.58MHz):

## LZ4

[LZ4](https://lz4.org) aims to achieve extremely fast decompression speeds, with a block format that trades size for simplicity.

## LZSA1

[LZSAv1](https://github.com/emmanuel-marty/lzsa) achieves better compression than LZ4 while still being very efficient to decode on 8-bit CPUs.

## LZSA2

[LZSAv2](https://github.com/emmanuel-marty/lzsa) achieves better compression than LZSAv1 while still being fairly efficient to decode on 8-bit CPUs. Of the decompressors included in this collection it has the largest code size, which is due to the somewhat involved [block format](https://github.com/emmanuel-marty/lzsa/blob/master/BlockFormat_LZSA2.md).

## Future work
- Implement [ZX0](https://github.com/einar-saukas/ZX0) decoder
- Improve test data set
- Include inlining on/off variants in tests and statistics
- Add optional bank crossing ability
