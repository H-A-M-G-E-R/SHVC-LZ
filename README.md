# SHVC-LZ

A collection of decoders for various modern variants of Lempel-Ziv style compression targeting the Super Famicom/Nintendo system. Written for the [ca65 assembler](https://cc65.github.io/doc/ca65.html), but should be easy to port to other assemblers.

Common characteristics:
- Designed for speed over code size
- Designed to run from ROM â€“ no self-modifying code
- Full 24-bit addresses for source and destination can be freely set at the call site
- Uses DMA registers for temporary variables allowing for faster access than RAM
- Uses DMA to copy literal strings
- The compressed data or the decompression buffer may not cross bank boundaries

## LZ4

[LZ4](https://lz4.org) aims to achieve extremely fast decompression speeds, with a block format that trades size for simplicity.

## LZSA1

[LZSAv1](https://github.com/emmanuel-marty/lzsa) achieves better compression than LZ4 while still being very efficient to decode on 8-bit CPUs.

## LZSA2

[LZSAv2](https://github.com/emmanuel-marty/lzsa) achieves better compression than LZSAv1 while still being fairly efficient to decode on 8-bit CPUs. Of the decompressors included in this collection it has the largest code size, which is due to the somewhat involved [block format](https://github.com/emmanuel-marty/lzsa/blob/master/BlockFormat_LZSA2.md).

Performance compared to the [reference](https://github.com/emmanuel-marty/lzsa/blob/master/asm/65816/decompress_v2.asm) 65816 implementation:

```

## ZX0

[ZX0](https://github.com/einar-saukas/ZX0) has the best compression ratio of the schemes included in this collection, which is achieved by encoding the length/match tokens in an [interlaced](https://github.com/einar-saukas/Zeta-Xi-Code?tab=readme-ov-file#factor-r) [Elias gamma coded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_gamma_coding) bit stream. The bit twiddling involved accounts for the slower speed compared to the pure byte aligned (nibble in the case of LZSA2) accesses needed by the other decompressors. But it is still quite fast, and the decompressor has the smallest byte count.
