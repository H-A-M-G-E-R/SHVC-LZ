# SHVC-LZ

A collection of decoders for various modern variants of Lempel-Ziv style compression targeting the Super Famicom/Nintendo system.

Common characteristics:
- Full 24-bit addresses for source and destination are freely set at the call site.
- Designed to run from ROM â€“ no self-modifying code.
- Uses DMA registers for temporary variables allowing for faster access than RAM.
- Uses DMA when copying literal strings.
- The compressed data or the decompression buffer may not cross bank boundaries.

# LZSA2

[LZSAv2](https://github.com/emmanuel-marty/lzsa) achieves better compression than LZ4 while still being fairly efficient to decode on 8-bit CPUs.

Performance compared to the [reference](https://github.com/emmanuel-marty/lzsa/blob/master/asm/65816/decompress_v2.asm) 65816 implementation:
